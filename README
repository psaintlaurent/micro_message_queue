This is apart of a collection of applications I'm going to be writing of minimalistic versions of common tools I've used for previous jobs.  I'm doing this, mostly, because I've found I don't use most of the features in a lot of existing tools, I figured I would pare them down to what I do use.

This is wildly incomplete and should be considered a work in progress...
